# ESIEE-2021-ROGUE-AI-BUILD
This is the build of the game we developed during our first year of school at ESIEE Paris ! It is a small game of survival in hostile terrain thanks to which we were able to discover unity

We developed it in team of 2 throughout the semester and presented it at the end. 

Will you manage to finish the game? LMAO you can't.
