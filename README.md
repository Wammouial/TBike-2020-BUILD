# ESIEE-2021-ROGUE-AI-BUILD

/!\ If you want to test the game by downloading the zip archive, you will have to download the following files individually because they are too big for the archive and add them in their place in the downloaded archive:

  - ./TBike_Data/sharedassets0.assets.resS 
  - ./TBike_Data/sharedassets0.resource

/!\ If you don't do this the game will be very ugly and non-functional !

This is the build of the game we developed during our first year of school at ESIEE Paris ! It is a small game of survival in hostile terrain thanks to which we were able to discover unity

We developed it in team of 2 throughout the semester and presented it at the end. 

Will you manage to finish the game? LMAO you can't.
